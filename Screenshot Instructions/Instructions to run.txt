0.	To run the simulator, run the start.bat file in the Simple MAS folder.
	- the .bat file contains the following commands:
	javac -cp lib/*; -d classes TwitterGatherDataFollowers/userRyersonU/*.java
	java -Xms256m -Xmx10240m -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -cp lib/*;classes jade.Boot -jade_domain_df_maxresult 1500 -jade_core_messaging_MessageManager_poolsize 10 -jade_core_messaging_MessageManager_maxqueuesize 2000000000 -jade_core_messaging_MessageManager_deliverytimethreshold 10000 -jade_domain_df_autocleanup true -local-port 35240 controller:TwitterGatherDataFollowers.userRyersonU.ControllerAgent	
	- for UNIX based systems, you can run the same commands but modifications are required to run
	- the maximum java heap memory -Xmx may need to be adjusted to your machine's memory capacity
1.	Click on performance measure button.
2.	Go to File and select Dataset From Text
3.	Select a dataset file.
4.	Whenever you select a dataset, you must first click 1. Get Users
5.	After getting the users, you can change the algorithm in the middle to whichever algorithm you like that are implemented and the number of nodes to the desired number. 
6.	After changing those parameters, you should click 2. Initialize
7.	When it is done initializing, you can click 3. Run Simulation
8.	Wait for the results, it may take a while depending on the size of the dataset.
9.	When it is done, you can see results in the top-right.
10.	To run another simulation, you can change the parameter for number of nodes and/or algorithm then YOU MUST INITIALIZE again before you run another simulation.
11.	Repeat as necessary until you get enough results.
